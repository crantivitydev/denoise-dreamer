# AI Processing Backend

This directory contains the Python backend for the AI image and audio processing services.

## Structure

- `models/` - Directory for trained ML models
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for processing
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Backend

Instructions for running the backend server will be added as the project develops.
